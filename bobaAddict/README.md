# Yelp Capital One Project: Boba Addict
In the mood for boba? With this handy dandy web app, you'll always know the best boba shop near you! This web app utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to find the best boba shops (up to 5) near you based on 4 simple search preferences of Distance, Price, if it's open now, and location. It also utilizes the Goole Maps API to map the user's current/specified location and the boba shop. In addition, there is a general search page for finding other restaurants that is formatted the same way.

# My Solution
I used this project to simplify a task my friends and I do very often: finding the best boba near us. When just trying to find a simple boba place on Yelp, you can easily get overwhelmed by all of the different filters, search preferences, and categories. When using Boba Addict, say goodbye to decision fatigue because your current location is automatically found using HTML5 Geolocation and the search is simplified to only the three filters most people really care about: Distance, Price, and if it's open now. After you hit the search button, up to 5 boba shops are returned in order of Yelp's best match. With each result, there is a link to the  business's Yelp page, directions, details (such as the distance, price, and rating), a Google Map with the user's and the boba shop's location, and a picture pulled from Yelp. I have also included a general search page for finding all kinds of restaurants.

# Challenge Prompt
(Copied from Mind Sumo)

We have all been there. Picking a restaurant can sometimes be a daunting task. Even with Yelp, it is never easy. The endless variables, from cuisine, price, and location to rating and hours, can be overwhelming.

Imagine you had the chance to create a web application that might make this process easier and more intuitive? How do you think you'd go about creating such an app?

We would like for you to build a web application using Yelp's Fusion API that will help users pick a restaurant or experience.  We want to see your creativity in action! Just make sure your solutions include these requirements:

1. Submit a deployed web application and include both your website URL and the supporting Github repository.
2. The app must use Yelp's Fusion API
3. Your app should be able to plot merchants on a map
4. Your app should be able to obtain user location via HTML5 Geolocation
